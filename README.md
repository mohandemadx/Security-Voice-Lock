# Security Voice-code Access

## Overview
Security Voice-code Access is a desktop application designed for secure access control using voice-code recognition. The software employs fingerprint and spectrogram concepts, offering two operational modes.

### Modes of Operation
1. **Security Voice Code Mode:**
   - Access restricted to specific pass-code sentences.
   - Valid passcodes: "Open middle door," "Unlock the gate," "Grant me access."

2. **Security Voice Fingerprint Mode:**
   - Access granted based on the individual(s) saying the valid passcode sentence.
   - Settings UI allows user selection of individuals (1 or more) from the original 8 users.

### User Interface Features
- **Voice-code Recording Button:** Initiate voice-code recording.
- **Spectrogram Viewer:** Visual representation of the spoken voice-code.
- **Analysis Results Summary:**
  - Table displaying match percentages for the spoken sentence against saved passcodes.
  - Table indicating match percentages for the spoken voice against each of the 8 saved individuals.
- **Access Status Indicator:** Clearly communicates results - "Access gained" or "Access denied."
